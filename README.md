# LoPy Ping Pong

**Please Note**: Work in progress

## Summary

This repo contains a [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/ The Things Network] demo setup for a [https://www.pycom.io/product/lopy/ LoPy] microcontroller communicating over [https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRa/Technology LoRa].
The demo does the following things:

1. Connect to The Things Network backend
2. Set a counter to 0
3. Sends the current counter value over LoRa to the The Things Network when the user presses the onboard button
4. Receives a (optional) data package from The Things Network
5. If the data parses to RGB value, sets the onboard color LED accordingly (otherwise, LED is switched off)
