# LoPy Ping Pong

**Please Note**: Work in progress

## Summary

This repo contains a [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)  demo setup for a [LoPy](https://www.pycom.io/product/lopy/) microcontroller communicating over [LoRa](https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRa/Technology).
The demo does the following things:

1. Connect to The Things Network backend
2. Set a counter to 0
3. Sends the current counter value over LoRa to the The Things Network when the user presses the onboard button
4. Receives a (optional) data package from The Things Network
5. If the data parses to RGB value, sets the onboard color LED accordingly (otherwise, LED is switched off)

The text below provides pointers to The Things Network, LoPy and setting the demo up.
